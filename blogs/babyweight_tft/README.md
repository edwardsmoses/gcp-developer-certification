# Data preprocessing for machine learning using TensorFlow Transform 

*Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.*

These are example notebooks to explain how you can create and train a Keras model using Tensorflow Transform.

## Setup

1. Create a new Google Cloud project and enable the following API. 
- Vertex AI API
- Notebooks API
- Dataflow API

2. Launch a new notebook instance from the "Vertex AI -> Workbench" menu. Choose "TensorFlow Enterprise 2.7 without GPUs" for the instance type.

3. Open JupyterLab and execute the following commond from the JupyterLab terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst.git
```

4. Open the notebook `training-data-analyst/blogs/babyweight_tft/babyweight_tft_keras_01.ipynb` and follow the instruction.

5. Open the notebook `training-data-analyst/blogs/babyweight_tft/babyweight_tft_keras_02.ipynb` and follow the instruction.
